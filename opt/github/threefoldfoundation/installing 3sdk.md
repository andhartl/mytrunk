## Installation overview

### Installing the 3sdk
The folllowing steps need to be documented
- checkout the jumpscaleX_core repository
- change to the unstable branche
- git pull
- go to install
- read instructions
- execute `./package.sh`
- move the binary to a central directory

Then start the `3sdk` binary.
- with an existing 3bot.connect account: use `container install words=''`
- enter you 3bot.identity name
- QUESTION: `specify secret passphrase please::` - does this mean the see or just a passphrase to encrypt the seed words.  I think it s passphrase to encrypt the keywords.  YES - the actual see key doe not get asked.  have to specifiy this at a later stage.

Errors:
- TF simulator provides an error when installing. does not install
- When deploying chatwizard things - user unknown error - both for the mainnet as well as testnet.
